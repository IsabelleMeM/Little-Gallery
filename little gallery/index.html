            <p>August Babberger (German,1885 - 1936)</p>
            <p class="descricao">
              August Babberger was a German painter. He was one of the
              protagonists of Expressionism and one of the most important
              artistic personalities of Classical Modernism in southwest
              Germany. Nevertheless, he is one of the almost forgotten artists
              of the early 20th century. The son of a carpenter, August
              Babberger was born in Hausen im Wiesental in 1885. He spent his
              most important school years in Basel, where his parents moved in
              1895. His talent for painting was noticed early on at secondary
              school. He later became an apprentice to a master painter. The
              young journeyman painter then traveled widely. In Munich, he tried
              to get into the art academy, but failed. In 1908, Babberger worked
              as a painter in Karlsruhe. His meeting with Hans Thoma there, to
              whom he showed his pen and ink drawings, was decisive. Thoma
              advised the 23-year-old to stay in Karlsruhe and study at the
              academy there. Babberger attended the etching class and received a
              scholarship to the International Art School in Florence the
              following year through Thoma's mediation. Babberger spent two
              winters there, painting and drawing mainly nudes. During these
              years, it was particularly important for him to gain the personal,
              lifelong friendship of the Graubünden painter Augusto Giacometti
              in addition to his artistic training. In addition to his interest
              in modern mural art, his search for the original in nature led him
              to discover pure landscape painting in the Swiss Alps from 1915
              onwards. In temporal and spatial proximity to Ernst Ludwig
              Kirchner, Babberger spent regular summer stays in an alpine hut on
              the Klausen Pass in the canton of Uri from 1918 onwards. After his
              marriage to the reverse glass painter and poet Anna Maria Tobler
              from Lucerne, Babberger moved to Frankfurt am Main. In 1919, he
              was a founding member of the Darmstadt Secession. In 1920, he was
              appointed Professor of Decorative Painting at the newly founded
              Landeskunstschule in Karlsruhe. He was director of this academy
              from 1923 to 1930. His art was already a bone of contention for
              some conservatives at this time, and soon after the seizure of
              power he was defamed as a "degenerate artist" by decree on July
              25, 1933 and removed from his teaching position. His colleague and
              fellow countryman from the Wiesental, the painter Hans Adolf
              Bühler, who was director of the academy at the time, played an
              inglorious role in this. Babberger moved to his wife's homeland,
              Switzerland. Years earlier, Babberger had repeatedly spent his
              summers on the Klausen Pass in the canton of Uri. It was here that
              he met the artist Erna Schillig, whom he made his model student
              and who later became his lover. Babberger created important works
              of art together with Erna Schillig. Together they painted the
              Höfli Chapel in Altdorf in 1932 and created the artist's book Vom
              Urnersee über den Klausenpass with woodcuts by Schillig and texts
              by Babberger. Schillig and Babberger also wrote the book Das
              Paradies der Höhensucher. Summer notes from the Klausen Pass. Not
              yet 51 years old, he died in 1936 in Altdorf, Canton Uri, as a
              result of neck surgery. Babberger's artistic estate was
              transferred to Altdorf and thus saved from the threat of seizure
              by the National Socialists. However, those in power in Germany
              continued to persecute the painter even after his death. In 1937,
              nine of his paintings were confiscated from public collections as
              part of the Nazi "Degenerate Art" campaign.

            <p>Claude Monet (French,1840-1926)</p>
            <p class="descricao">
              Oscar-Claude Monet was a French painter and founder of
              impressionist painting who is seen as a key precursor to
              modernism, especially in his attempts to paint nature as he
              perceived it. During his long career, he was the most consistent
              and prolific practitioner of impressionism's philosophy of
              expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied
              to plein air (outdoor) landscape painting. The term
              "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting
              Impression, soleil levant, exhibited in the 1874 ("exhibition of
              rejects") initiated by Monet and his associates as an alternative
              to the Salon. Monet was raised in Le Havre, Normandy, and became
              interested in the outdoors and drawing from an early age. Although
              his mother, Louise-Justine Aubrée Monet, supported his ambitions
              to be a painter, his father, Claude-Adolphe, disapproved and
              wanted him to pursue a career in business. He was very close to
              his mother, but she died in January 1857 when he was sixteen years
              old, and he was sent to live with his childless, widowed but
              wealthy aunt, Marie-Jeanne Lecadre. He went on to study at the
              Académie Suisse, and under the academic history painter Charles
              Gleyre, where he was a classmate of Auguste Renoir. His early
              works include landscapes, seascapes, and portraits, but attracted
              little attention. A key early influence was Eugène Boudin who
              introduced him to the concept of plein air painting. From 1883,
              Monet lived in Giverny, also in northern France, where he
              purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping
              project, including a water-lily pond. His ambition to document the
              French countryside led to a method of painting the same scene many
              times so as to capture the changing of light and passing of the
              seasons. Among the best known examples are his series of haystacks
              (1890–91), paintings of the Rouen Cathedral (1894) and the
              paintings of water lilies in his garden in Giverny that occupied
              him continuously for the last 20 years of his life. Frequently
              exhibited and successful during his lifetime, his fame and
              popularity soared in the second half of the 20th century when he
              became one of the world's most famous painters and a source of
              inspiration for burgeoning groups of artists.

            <p>Arthur Rackham (English, 1867-1939)</p>
            <p class="descricao">
              Arthur Rackham was an English book illustrator. He is recognised
              as one of the leading figures during the Golden Age of British
              book illustration. His work is noted for its robust pen and ink
              drawings, which were combined with the use of watercolour, a
              technique he developed due to his background as a journalistic
              illustrator. Rackham's 51 colour pieces for the Early American
              tale became a turning point in the production of books since –
              through colour-separated printing – it featured the accurate
              reproduction of colour artwork. Some of his best-known works
              include the illustrations for Rip Van Winkle, Peter Pan in
              Kensington Gardens, and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm. Rackham
              was born at 210 South Lambeth Road, Vauxhall, London as one of 12
              children. In 1884, at the age of 17, he was sent on an ocean
              voyage to Australia to improve his fragile health, accompanied by
              two aunts. At the age of 18, he worked as a clerk at the
              Westminster Fire Office and began studying part-time at the
              Lambeth School of Art. In 1892, he left his job and started
              working for the Westminster Budget as a reporter and illustrator.
              His first book illustrations were published in 1893 in To the
              Other Side by Thomas Rhodes, but his first serious commission was
              in 1894 for The Dolly Dialogues, the collected sketches of Anthony
              Hope, who later went on to write The Prisoner of Zenda. Book
              illustrating then became Rackham's career for the rest of his
              life. By the turn of the century, Rackham had developed a
              reputation for pen and ink fantasy illustration with richly
              illustrated gift books such as The Ingoldsby Legends (1898),
              Gulliver's Travels and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm (both
              1900). This was developed further through the austere years of the
              Boer War with regular contributions to children's periodicals such
              as Little Folks and Cassell's Magazine. In 1901 he moved to
              Wychcombe Studios near Haverstock Hill, and in 1903 married his
              neighbour Edyth Starkie. Edith suffered a miscarriage in 1904, but
              the couple had one daughter, Barbara, in 1908. Although
              acknowledged as an accomplished black-and-white book illustrator
              for some years, it was the publication of his full colour plates
              to Washington Irving's Rip Van Winkle by Heinemann in 1905 that
              particularly brought him into public attention, his reputation
              being confirmed the following year with J.M.Barrie's Peter Pan in
              Kensington Gardens, published by Hodder & Stoughton. Income from
              the books was greatly augmented by annual exhibitions of the
              artwork at the Leicester Galleries. Rackham won a gold medal at
              the Milan International Exhibition in 1906 and another one at the
              Barcelona International Exposition in 1912. His works were
              included in numerous exhibitions, including one at the Louvre in
              Paris in 1914. From 1906 the family lived in Chalcot Gardens, near
              Haverstock Hill, until moving from London to Houghton, West Sussex
              in 1920. In 1929 the family settled into a newly built property in
              Limpsfield, Surrey. Arthur Rackham died in 1939 of cancer at his
              home.

            <p>Aurélio Figueredo (Brazilian,1850 - 1899)</p>
            <p class="descricao">
              José Ferraz de Almeida Júnior, commonly known as Almeida Júnior,
              was a Brazilian artist and designer; one of the first there to
              paint in the Realistic tradition of Gustave Courbet and
              Jean-François Millet. The "Dia do Artista Plástico" (Day of Fine
              Artists in Brazil) is celebrated on his birthday. He was born in
              Itu. His art career began while he was working as a bell-ringer at
              the Church of Our Lady of Candelária in his native town. Some
              small works Júnior created on religious themes impressed the head
              priest enough to hold a fundraiser for him so he could go to Rio
              de Janeiro for formal art lessons. In 1869, he enrolled at the
              Academia Imperial de Belas Artes (Imperial Academy of Fine Arts),
              where he studied with Victor Meirelles and Pedro Américo. His
              simple country speech and manners made him stick out among the
              rest of the students, who were all from more urban areas. After
              graduating, he chose not to compete for a travel award to Europe,
              instead returning to Itu and setting up a studio there. During a
              tour of the São Paulo region in 1876, Emperor Pedro II saw
              Júnior's work and liked it. He personally offered Júnior his
              financial support. Later that year, Pedro II's royal decree
              awarded Júnior 300 francs per month for the purpose of studying in
              Paris. He soon settled in Montmartre and enrolled at the École des
              Beaux-Arts, becoming one of the many students of Alexandre
              Cabanel. While there, he participated in four of the Salons. He
              remained in Paris until 1882. Then, after a brief trip to Italy,
              he returned to Brazil and exhibited the works he had created
              during his absence. In 1883, he opened a studio in São Paulo and
              taught art privately. He also held exclusive art exhibitions and
              fulfilled commissions for portraits of notable people ranging from
              coffee barons to Republican politicians. In 1884, he held a
              showing at the Exposição Geral de Belas Artes and was made a
              knight of the Order of the Rose. A year later, Victor Meirelles,
              wanting to retire, offered Júnior his position as professor of
              history painting at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, but Júnior
              refused the offer because he preferred to stay in São Paulo. From
              1887 to 1896, he made three more trips to Europe. He increasingly
              rejected Biblical and historical subjects in favor of regionalist
              themes, depicting the everyday life of the caipiras while moving
              from academic style to Naturalism. Despite these changes, his
              reputation at the Imperial Academy remained unchallenged, and he
              received its Gold Medal in 1898. Júnior was stabbed to death in
              1899 by his cousin José de Almeida Sampaio in Piracicaba in front
              of the Hotel Central. Júnior had been having a long-standing
              affair with Sampaio's wife, Maria Laura do Amaral Gurgel, who had
              briefly been engaged to Júnior, and Sampaio had just found out
              about it.

            <p>Rosa Bonheur (French, 1822 - 1899)</p>
            <p class="descricao">
              Rosa Bonheur, born Marie-Rosalie Bonheur, was a French artist,
              mostly a painter of animals (animalière) but also a sculptor, in a
              realist style. Her paintings include Ploughing in the Nivernais,
              first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1848, and now at the Musée
              d'Orsay in Paris, and The Horse Fair (in French: Le marché aux
              chevaux), which was exhibited at the Salon of 1853 (finished in
              1855) and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York
              City. Bonheur was widely considered to be the most famous female
              painter of the nineteenth century. Bonheur was born on 16 March
              1822 in Bordeaux, Gironde, the oldest child in a family of
              artists. Her mother was Sophie Bonheur (born Marquis), a piano
              teacher; she died when Rosa was eleven. Her father was
              Oscar-Raymond Bonheur, a landscape and portrait painter who
              encouraged his daughter's artistic talents. Though of Jewish
              origin, the Bonheur family adhered to Saint-Simonianism, a
              Christian-socialist sect that promoted the education of women
              alongside men. Bonheur's siblings included the animal painters
              Auguste Bonheur and Juliette Bonheur, as well as the animal
              sculptor Isidore Jules Bonheur. Francis Galton used the Bonheurs
              as an example of "Hereditary Genius" in his 1869 essay of the same
              title. Bonheur moved to Paris in 1828 at the age of six with her
              mother and siblings, after her father had gone ahead of them to
              establish a residence and income there. By family accounts, she
              had been an unruly child and had a difficult time learning to
              read, though she would sketch for hours at a time with pencil and
              paper before she learned to talk. Her mother taught her to read
              and write by asking her to choose and draw a different animal for
              each letter of the alphabet. The artist credited her love of
              drawing animals to these reading lessons with her mother. At
              school she was often disruptive, and was expelled numerous times.
              After a failed apprenticeship with a seamstress at the age of
              twelve, her father undertook her training as a painter. Her father
              allowed her to pursue her interest in painting animals by bringing
              live animals to the family's studio for studying. Following the
              traditional art school curriculum of the period, Bonheur began her
              training by copying images from drawing books and by sketching
              plaster models. As her training progressed, she made studies of
              domesticated animals, including horses, sheep, cows, goats,
              rabbits and other animals in the pastures around the perimeter of
              Paris, the open fields of Villiers near Levallois-Perret, and the
              still-wild Bois de Boulogne. At fourteen, she began to copy
              paintings at the Louvre. Among her favorite painters were Nicolas
              Poussin and Peter Paul Rubens, but she also copied the paintings
              of Paulus Potter, Frans Pourbus the Younger, Louis Léopold Robert,
              Salvatore Rosa and Karel Dujardin. She studied animal anatomy and
              osteology in the abattoirs of Paris and dissected animals at the
              École nationale vétérinaire d'Alfort, the National Veterinary
              Institute in Paris. There she prepared detailed studies that she
              later used as references for her paintings and sculptures. During
              this period, she befriended the father-and-son comparative
              anatomists and zoologists, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and
              Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Rosa was also an open lesbian
              "first living with partner Nathalie Micas for over 40 years and
              then, after Micas' death, forging a relationship with American
              painter Anna Elizabeth Klumpke. By living her life openly in an
              era when lesbianism was disparaged by the government, Bonheur
              staked her claim as a groundbreaking individual both in her career
              and her personal life". A French government commission led to
              Bonheur's first great success, Ploughing in the Nivernais,
              exhibited in 1849 and now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. Her most
              famous work, the monumental The Horse Fair, was completed in 1855
              and measured eight feet high by sixteen feet wide. It depicts the
              horse market held in Paris, on the tree-lined boulevard de
              l'Hôpital, near the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, which is visible
              in the painting's background. There is a reduced version in the
              National Gallery in London. This work led to international fame
              and recognition; that same year she traveled to Scotland and met
              Queen Victoria en route, who admired Bonheur's work. In Scotland,
              she completed sketches for later works including Highland
              Shepherd, completed in 1859, and A Scottish Raid, completed in
              1860. These pieces depicted a way of life in the Scottish
              highlands that had disappeared a century earlier, and they had
              enormous appeal to Victorian sensibilities. Bonheur exhibited her
              work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman's Building at the
              1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Though she
              was more popular in England than in her native France, she was
              decorated with the French Legion of Honour by the Empress Eugénie
              in 1865, and was promoted to Officer of the order in 1894. She was
              the first female artist to be given this award. Bonheur was
              represented by the art dealer Ernest Gambart (1814–1902). In 1855
              he brought Bonheur to the United Kingdom, and he purchased the
              reproduction rights to her work. Many engravings of Bonheur's work
              were created from reproductions by Charles George Lewis
              (1808–1880), one of the finest engravers of the day. In 1859 her
              success enabled her to move to the Château de By near
              Fontainebleau, not far from Paris, where she lived for the rest of
              her life. The house is now a museum dedicated to her. Women were
              often only reluctantly educated as artists in Bonheur's day, and
              by becoming such a successful artist she helped to open doors to
              the women artists that followed her. Bonheur can be viewed as a
              "New Woman" of the 19th century; she was known for wearing men's
              clothing, but she attributed her choice of trousers to their
              practicality for working with animals (see Rational dress). In her
              romantic life, she was fairly openly a lesbian; she lived with her
              first partner, Nathalie Micas, for over 40 years until Micas'
              death, and later began a relationship with the American painter
              Anna Elizabeth Klumpke. At a time when lesbian sex – particularly
              tribadism – was regarded as animalistic and deranged by most
              French officials, Bonheur's outspokenness about her personal life
              was groundbreaking. In a world where gender expression was
              policed, Rosa Bonheur broke boundaries by deciding to wear pants,
              shirts and ties. She did not do this because she wanted to be a
              man, though she occasionally referred to herself as a grandson or
              brother when talking about her family; rather, Bonheur identified
              with the power and freedom reserved for men. Wearing men's
              clothing gave Bonheur a sense of identity in that it allowed her
              to openly show that she refused to conform to societies'
              construction of the gender binary. It also broadcast her sexuality
              at a time where the lesbian stereotype consisted of women who cut
              their hair short, wore pants, and chain-smoked. Rosa Bonheur did
              all three. Bonheur never explicitly said she was a lesbian, but
              her lifestyle and the way she talked about her female partners
              suggests this. Until 2013 women in France were forbidden from
              wearing trousers by the “Decree concerning the cross-dressing of
              women” which was implemented on 17 November 1800. Bonheur in 1852
              had to ask permission from the police to wear trousers, as this
              was her preferred attire to go to the sheep and cattle markets to
              study the animals she painted. Bonheur, while taking pleasure in
              activities usually reserved for men (such as hunting and smoking),
              viewed her womanhood as something far superior to anything a man
              could offer or experience. She viewed men as stupid and mentioned
              that the only males she had time or attention for were the bulls
              she painted. Having chosen to never become an adjunct or appendage
              to a man in terms of painting, she decided she would be her own
              boss and that she would lean on herself and her female partners
              instead. She had her partners focus on the home life while she
              took on the role of breadwinner by focusing on her painting.
              Bonheur's legacy paved the way for other lesbian artists who
              didn't favour the life society had laid out for them. Bonheur died
              on 25 May 1899, at the age of 77, at Thomery (By), France. She was
              buried together with Nathalie Micas (1824 – 24 June 1889), her
              lifelong companion, at Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. Klumpke was
              Bonheur's sole heir after her death, and later joined Micas and
              Bonheur in the same cemetery upon her death. Many of her
              paintings, which had not previously been shown publicly, were sold
              at auction in Paris in 1900.

            <p class="descricao">
              Emma Ciardi was an Italian painter. Ciardi was born in Venice.
              Following in the footsteps of her father Guglielmo and brother
              Beppe, Emma Ciardi began painting as an adolescent and exhibited
              for the first time in 1900 at the Exposition Universelle in Paris,
              and at the Promotrice in Turin; in 1903 she participated in the
              Esposizione Internazionale d’Arte di Venezia and took part in it
              almost every year after that until 1932. In addition to her
              landscapes and views of Venice, she also soon made a name for
              herself with neo-18th-century subjects which were particularly
              well received by the English and American public. In 1910 she
              organised her first solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in
              London, followed by a second in 1913; she also had other
              exhibitions mounted in London by the Fine Art Society in 1928 and
              1933. In the USA market she received acclaim from 1923 onwards,
              when she exhibited at the Howard Young Gallery in New York City,
              which obtained exclusive rights to selling her work. She died in
              Venice in 1933. Two years after her death, Ciardi’s painting was
              celebrated in a retrospective on the occasion of the fortieth
              anniversary of the Venice Biennale.

            <p>Anna Nordlander (Swedish, 1843 - 1879)</p>
            <p class="descricao">
              Anna Catharina Nordlander, was a Swedish painter. She is known for
              her portraits and her depictions of genre- nature- and folk life:
              she is also counted as a pioneer in the illustration of the lives
              of the Forest Sami (Skogssamar) of northern Sweden. Anna
              Nordlander was born in the vicarage at Skellefteå in Västerbotten
              County, Sweden to Nils Nordlander (1796–1874) and Anna Maria
              Gestrin. Her father was parish vicar and in 1841 among the
              founders of the town of Skellefteå. She studied at the Royal
              Swedish Academy of Arts (1866) under Jean-François Portaels in
              Brussels and at the Académie Julian in Paris. Nordlander is
              represented in several Swedish museums including the
              Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. She was not particularly acknowledged
              until the late 20th-century. Her artistic pursuit first attracted
              broader attention posthumously. Nordlander died in Härnösand at 36
              years old.
